saturn
======

An emulator for the [DCPU-16](http://www.dcpu.com) platform.

Saturn requires SFML for much of its external interaction.
All the distribution repositories I found did not have an up to date version, so you will have to compile from source.
Saturn uses v2.* of SFML.

Saturn also relies on a compiler compatible with C++11
